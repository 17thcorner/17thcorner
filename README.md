<h2>ðŸ”¶ INTERACTING</h2>
im all good with anyone interacting as long as you aren't in my dni, i have no hate towards anyone in the area ðŸ”¸ c+h is always appreciated, except if ive got any dni acronyms in my name ðŸ”¸ im not a big fan of roleplays, but goofing around is fun for me too ðŸ”¸ i get overwhelmed easily with crowds so i will back away if people get too much ðŸ”¸ dont copy my ponies if you dont wanna be original, but you can take inspo 
<br>
<h2>ðŸ”¶ DO NOT INTERACT</h2>
<p> anyone under 14, for maturity difference ðŸ”¸ if you intend to make sexual jokes with me ðŸ”¸ if i unfriend you, just iwec cause i prob am not a fan of you lmao</p>
<h2>BEFORE YOU FRIEND</h2>  
im very overprotective over myself so if i do get a wrong signal from you and ignore you i probably got the wrong sign, so do try to clarify with me
