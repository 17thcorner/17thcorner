# GENERALINFO !
  - my name is corner (mostly prefered), but im okay with ban or dj as nicknames, this is a little thing for an introduction
<h2>INTERACTING</h2>
  - im all good with anyone interacting as long as you aren't in my dni, i have no hate towards anyone in the area
  - c+h is always appreciated, except if ive got any dni acronyms in my name
  - im not a big fan of roleplays, but goofing around is fun for me too
  - i get overwhelmed easily with crowds so i will back away if people get too much
  - dont copy my ponies if you dont wanna be original, but you can take inspo
